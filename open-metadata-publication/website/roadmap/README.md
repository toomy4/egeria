# Egeria Road Map and Destination

Egeria is a large project with many different activities
adding content to the project.   This page provides an overview
of the aims of the project and a reflection of where we are today.

Figure 1 shows the three layers of capability that
Egeria is aiming for.

> **Figure 1:** Three layers of capability for Egeria

Although some progress has been made on all layers,
they do build on one another.
So, not surprisingly, most of the work has been focused on
establishing the frameworks, connector APIs and other
services to provide the developer platform.

In recent months, and going into 2020, our focus is
shifting to the integration platform as we add
connector implementations for popular third party
technologies and expand out the user interfaces (UIs).

The support for the governance solutions will then naturally
follow along.  

The governance solutions themselves sit naturally along side specific metadata and governance
solutions available in the market today.  Egeria is focused on filling in the gaps to
support individuals that are setting up and running an open metadata ecosystem and wish to
take advantage of the enterprise perspective it beings.

Figure 2 steps into a little more detail and expands out the types of functions
found in each layer:

> **Figure 2:** Functions found in each layer of capability for Egeria

Follow the links for more information about the functions shown in the three layers:

* [Governance Solution](governance-solution-functional-detail.md)
* [Integration Platform](integration-platform-functional-detail.md)
* [Developer Platform](developer-platform-functional-detail.md)

Figure 3 shows an overview of the status of the functions.  Green means that
there is function that is either [released or technical preview](../content-status).
Orange means there is work going on and red means it is planned but not started.

This chart will be updated with each [release](../../../release-notes).
