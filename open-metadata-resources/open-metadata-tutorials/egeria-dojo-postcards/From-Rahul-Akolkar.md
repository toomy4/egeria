[ODPi Egeria](https://egeria.odpi.org/) is an open source project dedicated to making metadata open and automatically exchanged between tools and data platforms, no matter which vendor they come from.

One of the best ways to get started and begin participating in the open community is to particpate in an Egeria dojo, or even host one!
