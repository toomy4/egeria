# The Egeria Dojo

The Egeria Dojo is an intensive course to help you learn about Egeria.
It is designed as a 3 day effort, although, since it is self-study you can
dip in and out of it as time permits.

The objectives of the three day are as follows:

* **Day 1**: Learning about setting up and running Egeria on you own machine.
* **Day 2**: Learning how to make a contribution to Egeria
* **Day 3**: Learning how to become either an advocate or a maintainer

The sessions are color-coded like ski runs.

![Red - Advanced sessions](egeria-dojo-session-coding-red-advanced-session.png)

![Black - Expert sessions](egeria-dojo-session-coding-black-expert-session.png)


As you progress through the dojo, the colors of the sessions
show how advanced your knowledge is becoming.

The schedule also includes estimated times needed to complete
each session as well as breaks to give your mind a rest from time to time.

## Day 1

After completing day 1 of the Egeria dojo you should feel
comfortable with setting up and running the Egeria technology.
It includes sessions on the prerequisite technology that Egeria uses,
how to configure Egeria, how to start and stop various capabilities
and well as diagnosing any problems you may come across.

## Day 2

Day 2 of the Egeria dojo is all about making changes to the
Egeria project.  This may be to add code, documentation or samples.
You will have an opportunity to add a new file to the Egeria project
and take it all the way through the process to update Egeria's git repository.

## Day 3

Day 3 prepares you to become an Egeria professional - either
as an advocate of the technology or a maintainer.
It goes much deeper into the philosophy, design and processes
of the project.
