# Becoming an Egeria contributor

In this session, you will learn about how to be recognized as an Egeria Contributor by the Egeria community.

An **Egeria Contributor** is someone who has made multiple quality contributions to the Egeria community.
This role is described in the [Operations Guide](../../../Egeria-Operations.md).

## Egeria badges

To recognise individuals who are established contributors to the Egeria project,
the Egeria community is able to award [Acclaim badges](../../../developer-resources/badges).

* How many contributors are listed for the Egeria project?
