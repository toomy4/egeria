# Tools for Contributors

In this session, you will learn about the tools that many of the maintainers and contributors
use when they are working on Egeria.
With the exception of tools that are embedded on our processes, such as Git and Maven,
you are not required to use the same tools.
However, if you are using the same tools and you get stuck
then the Egeria community is more likely to be able to help.

## Test yourself

Once you have reviewed details of the tools try to answer these questions:

* What is the command to create a clean complete build of Egeria?
* How long does the complete build of Egeria take?
* What is the difference between a fork and a clone?
* What is the Postman collection used for?
* Which version of IntelliJ do you need to build contributions for Egeria?
