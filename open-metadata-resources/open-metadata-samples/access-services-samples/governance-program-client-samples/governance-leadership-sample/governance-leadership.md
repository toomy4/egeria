# Governance Leadership Sample

In the governance leadership sample, Jules Keeper, the CDO at
Coco Pharmaceuticals, is setting up details about their
governance leaders.

He first creates a personal profile for himself and Ivor Padlock.

Next he creates governance officer positions for:

* The Chief Data Officer (CDO)
* The Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
* The Chief Security Officer (CSO)

He appoints himself as the CDO and the CPO and Ivor as the CSO.

He later persuades Faith Broker to take on the role of CPO.
He creates a new profile for Faith, removes himself as the CPO
and appoints Faith in his place.

He also updates his personal profile to reflect he is no longer CPO.

Jules also wants to recognize the work that Erin Overview
does in supporting the information architecture for their
systems and also Gary Geeke's work running the IT infrastructure.

He appoints Erin as the CDO for the IT Systems and
Gary as the Chief IT Officer responsible for the
IT governance domain.

Completing the team, Reggie Mint from finance is the corporate
governance officer and Polly Tasker is responsible for the
software development lifecycle governance domain.

Talking to Ivor at a later date, they decide to change the
"Chief Security Officer (CSO)" to be the "Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)".

Throughout the sample, Jules is checking that he can retrieve the
definitions that he is creating.

At the end of the sample, all of the definitions are deleted
so the sample can run again without error.
