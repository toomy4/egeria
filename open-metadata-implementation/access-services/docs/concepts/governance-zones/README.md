# Governance Zones

A **Governance Zone** defines a list of assets that are grouped together for a specific purpose.

A zone may represent assets that are consumed or managed in a particular way; or should only be
visible to particular groups of users,
or processed by particular types of engine.
There may also be zones used to indicate that the asset is in a particular state.  

For example,
Coco Pharmaceuticals use a quarantine zone for data that has arrived from an external partner.
It is not visible to the researchers until it has been cataloged and verified.  Then it is added
to the zones that others can see.

Zones are typically independent of one another, but they can be nested if desired.

An asset can belong to all, one or many zones.  The list of zones that an asset belongs to is configured in
its **zoneMembership** property.  If it is blank, it means the asset logically belongs to all zones.
Otherwise it belongs only to the zones that are listed.  It is added to or removed from
a zone by updating the asset's zoneMembership property.

All Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs) that retrieve assets, such as
[Asset Catalog](../../../asset-catalog), [Asset Consumer](../../../asset-consumer) and [Asset Owner](../../../asset-owner),
use the **supportedZones** option that is configured for the service in the
in their server's configuration document.
This property defines the zones of assets that can be returned by this instance of the access service.

In addition, access services that create assets, use the **defaultZones** option to define
the list of zones set up in any new asset they create.

Finally access services that are synchronizing assets between different third party
technologies, such as the [Data Platform OMAS](../../../data-platform), will also use the
**publishZones** option to publish an asset to consumer zones once they are completely defined in the
catalog.

The meaning, purpose and governance requirements for assets within a specific zone are maintained through
the [Governance Program](../../../governance-program) OMAS.

It is also possible to associate
[security access control with a governance zone](../../../../common-services/metadata-security).
