/**
 * DigitalServiceImplementationStyle characterizes the implementation style of the digital service.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         UNCLASSIFIED - The digital service implementation style is undefined.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         API - The digital service provides one or more APIs.  This means the consumers are going to be
 *         other digital services.  Typically API services are data processors.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         PERSONAL_APP - The digital service provides a user interface via a client application that is owned and
 *         installed by the end user.  A mobile app for a smart phone or tablet is an example of this type of digital
 *         service.  It means that the data subject and the end user is aligned.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         BROWSER_APP - The digital service provides a user interface via a browser.  There is no guarantee that
 *         the same user will access the service through a browser instance if the browser is on a shared machine.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         LOCATION_APP - The digital service is installed at a specific location and is monitoring activity at the
 *         location and providing the service at that location.  Some locations are closely aligned with individuals
 *         (such as in the home) and this needs to be taken into account with reviewing privacy and security
 *         requirements.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         INFRASTRUCTURE_APP - The digital service is installed as part of some infrastructure (for example
 *         a vehicle, or a power-distribution grid) and it is monitoring
 *         and supporting the operation of that infrastructure.  Some pieces of infrastructure are closely associated
 *         with an individual (such as a person's car) which may have implications for privacy and security.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         DATA_FEED - The digital service continuously produces data that consumers can subscribe to.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         DATA_SINK - The digital service is receiving and accumulating data from other digital services.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         CLIENT_SERVER - The digital service provides a thick client tightly coupled with a backend server.
 *         Often these are standalone applications bought in as a package or home-grown.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         OTHER - The digital service's implementation style is locally defined.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
