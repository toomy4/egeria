/**
 * DigitalServiceStatus tracks the life cycle of a digital service.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         DRAFT - The digital service definition is a draft.  Typically the initial description is being written up by
 *         the enterprise/data/solution architect in conjunction with the business owner.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         PROPOSED - The digital service definition is in planning and business review.  Its initial definition is
 *         complete and the team are reviewing it for viability.  This includes a governance review (such as a data
 *         processing impact assessment) that needs to occur before development starts.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         APPROVED_CONCEPT - The digital service definition is approved for development.  All governance checks are
 *         in place and it is waiting for the development team to get started.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         UNDER_DEVELOPMENT - The development team is at work.  This covers the technical implementation and the
 *         business development activity necessary to go live with the digital service.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         APPROVED_FOR_DEPLOYMENT - The digital service definition is approved for deployment.  This means the
 *         software components for the digital service can be deployed and made available to its consumers.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         ACTIVE - The digital service definition is approved and in use.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         DEPRECATED - The digital service definition is no longer active.  It may have been replaced by another
 *         digital service or deactivated because it is no longer needed, viable or profitable.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         OTHER - The digital service definition in a locally defined state.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
