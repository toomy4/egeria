# Configuration Documents

A configuration document provides the configuration details for a single
[OMAG Server](omag-server.md).  It defines which subsystems are activated
in the server and which connector implementations it should use.

## Configuration document structure

An OMAG Server's configuration document is structured into elements that each describe the
configuration properties for each of its desired capabilities.

Figure 1 provides more details.

![Figure 1](configuration-document-structure.png)
> **Figure 1:** Structure of the configuration document


The sections are as follows:

* [Default values](#Default-Values) to use when creating other configuration elements.  These values need to be set up first
* [Basic properties](#Basic-Properties-for-any-OMAG-Server) of any OMAG server.
* [Configuration for specific subsystems](#Services-for-specific-types-of-OMAG-Server) that provide the
  key capabilities for different types of OMAG Servers.
* [Audit trail](#Audit-Trail) that documents the changes that have been made to the configuration document.


### Default Values

At the top of the configuration document are **Local Server URL Root** and **Event Bus Config**.
 * The local server URL root defines the root of the network address for the
[OMAG Server Platform](omag-server-platform.md) where the OMAG Server will run.
 * The event bus configuration provides the configuration of the event bus (Apache Kafka or similar)
 where all of the event topics that the server will use are located.

Both of these elements provide default values for other configuration
elements.

If they are changed, their new values
do not affect existing definitions in the configuration document.

* [Configuring the Default Event Bus](../user/configuring-event-bus.md)

### Audit Trail

The audit trail allows you to keep track of changes to the configuration document.
This is helpful what any recent changes might have been - particularly if a working server
suddenly stops working - the first question is always, "what has changed recently?".

It also acts as a nice summary of how the server has been configured.

Below is an example of an audit trail:

```
{
 "auditTrail" : [
    "Thu Jan 30 22:37:12 GMT 2020 garygeeke updated configuration for local server's URL root to http://localhost:8081.",

## Storage of the configuration document

By default the configuration document are stored as JSON in a file in the default directory
for the [OMAG Server Platform](omag-server-platform.md) that creates them.

These files may contain security certificates and passwords and so should be treated as sensitive.
It is possible to change the storage location of configuration documents - or even the type of store.
See [Configuration document Store Connector](configuration-document-store-connector.md)
for more information.

configuration document take connection objects for connectors.
