# Platform Services

The platform services provides the APIs for querying the
[Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server Platform](../admin-services/docs/concepts/omag-server-platform.md)
and discovering information about the OMAG Servers that it is hosting.

There are two parts to the platform services:

* **OMAG Server Platform Origin Service** - returns a platform identifier that indicates which version of the
  platform is running.
  
* **OMAG Server Platform Active Service** - returns information about the known and active servers
  running on the platform along with definitions of each type of Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG)
  services.
