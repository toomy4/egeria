# Slack

Slack is an instance messaging tool that allows multiple conversations to occur
amongst the community members at any one time.  Each conversation is called a **channel**.
Channels can be set up for a specific event or have a long term existence.

The Egeria community has multiple channels on the ODPi's slack service
at 

Egeria uses the [ODPi's Slack community](http://slack.odpi.org/) to provide an ongoing dialogue between members.
This creates a recorded discussion of design decisions and discussions that complement the project meetings.

Follow the link above and register with the ODPi slack service using your email address.
Once signed in you can see all of the active slack channels.
The main slack channel for the Egeria project is called `#egeria-project`:

[https://odpi.slack.com/messages/CAZDMLTFF](https://odpi.slack.com/messages/CAZDMLTFF]).

Additional channels are added from time to time as new workgroups and discussion topics are established.
