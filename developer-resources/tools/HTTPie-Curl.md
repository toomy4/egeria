# Command line Http request tools - HTTPie and Curl

In addition to [Postman](Postman.md) there are command line tools for
calling REST APIs.

The command that is most commonly available is **curl**.
It uses commands such as:

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/open-metadata/platform-services/users/test/server-platform/origin
ODPi Egeria OMAG Server Platform (version 1.8-SNAPSHOT)
```

As an alternative you might like to try [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) which has more advanced functions
